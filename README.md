Description:  The goal of the app is to create an easy to use search bar that allows the user to find objects in the theater. It gives a full description and an image. It also uses key words to search items.

Nov 9: Researched how to make a search bar for the app
Nov 13: Spent most of the time researching search bars. The rest of the time was spent planning out how the app would look.
Nov 16: started working on logo and description
Nov 28: Finished logo, started working on background art, started researching more about search bars
Nov 30: continued to learn about search bars and started writing code 
Dec 4: Spent the entire time working on the code
Dec 6: Worked on fixing spelling errors and continuing the code for the search bar
Dec 10: I was able to fix most of the errors after starting over with the code but the app still won't build

Reviews:

Very good idea, I think this will prove very useful in practical use! This is a rather challenging project as well (I suppose you need to keep track of the real-time location of props and be able to look anything up which seems so hard!), and I can tell you're working hard toward it XD    One little suggestion I have is that you can expand the market to home and office uses, as these locations are places where people tend to lose things. A related little invention about lost-and-found I know about is a kind of tiles, hope it can give you some inspirations maybe?

Excellent idea that fills a true need! I think that the full execution would be very time consuming but ultimately enormously helpful to the Theater department. Knowing what's "in stock," in use, and where items are located would be very helpful to the tech crew and directors. It may also allow you to note the condition of items, when things need to be replaced, and record how often items are being used (if at all). I could imagine this app being used for other purposes as well--retail spaces, thrift shops, homes, etc. It is very practical and a great tool for those seeking organizational solutions! I did not get to see the app in action because the code was not completed, so that is the only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5.
